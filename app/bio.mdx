Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am a senior studying mathematics at Stanford University, and also a coterminal Master's student in theoretical computer science. I like thinking about problems over **coffee**, hence the color theme of this website. In my free time I also enjoy drawing, programming, tennis, pickleball, going to the beach, and exploring new places.

I'm mostly interested in the subject of **algebraic geometry** and problems in enumerative geometry. These kinds of questions are best illustrated with an example. 

> Take it on faith that only $1$ rational conic passes through $5$ points in general position, but $12$ rational cubics pass through $8$ such points. In general, how do we count the number of rational degree $d$ curves passing through $3d-1$ points in general position? 

The question is secretly about moduli spaces with very ugly notations, i.e.
$$
\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)
$$

I have a couple of **blog posts** that I write, including ones that go into more detail on this specific problem (see Kontsevich curve counting), which are mainly on mathematics that I find interesting but for which I don't have a full set of coherent notes. Feel free to check them out below.

My **projects** page contains some papers I have authored or co-authored, as well as various notes from classes I have taken while at Stanford.
