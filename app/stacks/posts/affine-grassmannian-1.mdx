This is the first post in a series on a central object in the study of the geometric Langland's conjecture, the affine Grassmannian. I will be giving first properties of this object according to the lecture notes that Professor Xinwen Zhu compiled for a lecture series at the 2015 Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI). The reader should have a good background in algebraic geometry (schemes, sheaves, stacks) and be somewhat familiar with the topological uniformization theorem on loop groups.

Throughout this post, we will use the following notation. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$ an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. The space
$$
D = \spec k[[z]]
$$
will denote the formal unit disk, and similarly
$$
D^* = \spec k((z))
$$
will denote the formal puntured unit disk. Let $R$ be a $k$-algebra. By an $R$-**family of lattices** in $k((z))^n$ we mean a finitely generated projective $R[[z]]$-module $\Lambda$ of $R((z))$ such that $\Lambda \otimes_{R[[z]]} R((z)) = R((z))^n$. 

The **affine Grassmannian** $\Gr_{\GL_n}$ for $\GL_n$ is the presheaf
